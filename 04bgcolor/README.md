# Background Color Changer

This project is a simple **React + Vite** application that allows users to dynamically change the **background color** by clicking different buttons.  
The main goal was to practice **state management** and **inline styling** in React.

### Key Learnings
- Using the **`useState`** hook to store and update the selected color.
- Applying **inline styles** in React components based on state values.
- Handling **button click events** to trigger UI changes.
- Building an interactive and visually responsive interface with minimal code.

This project demonstrates how small React components can create a smooth, real-time user experience.
