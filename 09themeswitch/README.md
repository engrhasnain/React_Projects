# Theme Switch (Context API)

This project is a **React + Vite** application built to understand and implement the **Context API** for global state management.  
The goal was to create a simple **Theme Switcher** that toggles between **light** and **dark** modes using a single button.

### Key Features
- **Global State Management**: Used the **Context API** to manage the theme state across the entire app.
- **Theme Toggle**: Switch between **Black (Dark Mode)** and **White (Light Mode)** with one click.
- **Reusable Components**: Components dynamically adapt to the current theme.

### Key Learnings
- Why and when to use **Context API** instead of passing props manually (prop drilling).
- Creating a **context provider** to share data across the component tree.
- Comparing **Context API** with **Redux** for managing global state.
- Implementing **dynamic styling** based on context values.

This project strengthens understanding of **React Context API** as a simpler alternative to Redux for smaller applications.
