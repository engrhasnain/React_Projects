# React Router Practice

This project is a **React + Vite** application built to understand and implement **React Router** for client-side navigation.  
The main goal was to learn how to create multi-page React applications without reloading the page.

### Key Features
- **Routing Setup**: Implemented routes using `createBrowserRouter` and `createRoutesFromElements`.
- **Dynamic Routing**: Used URL parameters (e.g., `/user/:id`) to render dynamic content.
- **Nested Routes & Layouts**: Learned to use the `Outlet` component to create shared layouts and nested routes.
- **Reusable Components**: Created pages like **Home**, **About**, **Contact**, **Github**, and **User** with clean structure.
- **Navigation**: Practiced linking between pages without full page refreshes.

### Key Learnings
- Configuring **React Router v6** for SPA (Single Page Application) navigation.
- Understanding **nested routes** and how the `Outlet` component helps render child components.
- Passing and handling **route parameters** for dynamic page rendering.
- Building a scalable folder structure with multiple components and pages.

This project serves as a foundation for building **multi-page React applications** with seamless navigation.
