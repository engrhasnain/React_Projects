# ViteBasics

This project is a simple exploration of **Vite** with **React** to understand how it differs from using the traditional `create-react-app` command.  
During this project, I learned:

- How to create a React project using **Vite**.
- Key differences between **Vite** and **Create React App (CRA)**.
- Understanding and using the **.jsx** file format.

This serves as a beginner-friendly reference for setting up fast and efficient React projects with Vite.
