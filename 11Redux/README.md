# Todo App (Redux)

This project is a **React + Vite** application that implements a fully functional **Todo App** using **Redux** for state management.  
It allows users to **add**, **edit**, **update**, and **delete** tasks while demonstrating how to manage global state with Redux.

### Key Features
- **Add Tasks**: Create new todos and store them in the Redux store.
- **Edit & Update**: Modify existing tasks with real-time updates.
- **Delete Tasks**: Remove tasks from the list seamlessly.
- **Centralized State**: All data is managed through the **Redux store**, ensuring a predictable state flow.

### Key Learnings
- Setting up a **Redux store** and integrating it with a React application.
- Creating **actions** and **reducers** to handle state updates.
- Using **Redux hooks** (`useSelector`, `useDispatch`) for accessing and modifying state.
- Understanding the difference between **Context API** and **Redux** for larger, more complex applications.

This project strengthens knowledge of **Redux architecture** and provides a solid foundation for building  
scalable applications that require robust global state management.
