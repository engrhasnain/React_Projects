# Currency Exchange App

This project is a **React + Vite** application that converts currencies in real-time using an external API.  
The main focus was to practice **custom hooks**, **component reusability**, and **API integration** in React.

### Key Features
- **Live Currency Conversion**: Convert from one currency to another with up-to-date exchange rates.
- **Swap Functionality**: Instantly swap the "From" and "To" currencies.
- **Reusable Components**: Built a flexible `InputBox` component to handle currency input and selection.
- **Custom Hook (`useCurrencyInfo`)**: Fetches currency exchange rates using the `fetch` method for clean and modular code.
- **Responsive UI**: Styled with Tailwind CSS for a modern and mobile-friendly interface.

### Key Learnings
- Creating and using **custom hooks** for data fetching (`useCurrencyInfo`).
- Handling **API calls** and managing asynchronous operations with `fetch`.
- Building **reusable components** to keep code DRY and organized.
- Managing multiple pieces of state with **`useState`** to handle amounts, currency options, and conversions.

This project strengthens skills in **React hooks**, API integration, and creating scalable, maintainable applications.
