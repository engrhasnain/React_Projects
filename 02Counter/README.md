# React/Vite Counter App

This project is a simple **Counter Application** built with **React** and **Vite**.  
The core idea of this project is to learn and practice **React state management** using the `useState` hook.

### Key Learnings
- Using the **`useState`** hook to manage and update component state.
- Handling **button click events** to increment and decrement a counter.
- Implementing **conditional logic** to prevent negative counter values.
- Understanding how **state updates** and **re-rendering** work in React.

This small project reinforces the basics of interactive UI development in React.
