# Todo App (Context API)

This project is a **React + Vite** application that demonstrates a fully functional **Todo App** with features to  
**add**, **edit**, **update**, and **delete** tasks.  
The main purpose of this project was to practice and understand **React Context API** for managing global state.

### Key Features
- **Add Tasks**: Create new todos with instant updates.
- **Edit & Update**: Modify existing tasks and save changes seamlessly.
- **Delete Tasks**: Remove tasks from the list with a single click.
- **Global State Management**: All task operations are managed globally using **Context API**, avoiding prop drilling.

### Key Learnings
- Using **Context API** to share and manage state across multiple components.
- Structuring the app with **context providers** and **consumers** for better scalability.
- Handling CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations in a React application.
- Improving UI reactivity through efficient state updates.

This project provides a strong foundation for building more complex applications that require **centralized state management**.
